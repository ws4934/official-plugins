# linapro-demo-source

`linapro-demo-source` is the source-plugin sample for `LinaPro`. It demonstrates an in-repo plugin that is discovered by the host, installed explicitly from plugin management, and mounted into the default workspace.

## What This Sample Demonstrates

- install SQL under `manifest/sql/` creates the plugin-owned table `plugin_linapro_demo_source_record`
- mock SQL under `manifest/sql/mock-data/` provides optional demo records for local sample data
- uninstall SQL under `manifest/sql/uninstall/` drops the plugin-owned table when the user confirms storage purge
- the sample page in `frontend/pages/sidebar-entry.vue` performs CRUD against the plugin-owned table and supports attachment upload/download
- plugin-owned attachment files are stored under the host upload root in the `linapro-demo-source/` namespace
- disabling the plugin hides menus and routes but keeps table data and stored files
- uninstalling the plugin opens a confirmation dialog that lets the user choose whether to purge plugin-owned table data and stored files
- lifecycle callbacks log `BeforeInstall`, `AfterInstall`, `BeforeUpgrade`, `Upgrade`, `AfterUpgrade`, `BeforeDisable`, `AfterDisable`, `BeforeUninstall`, `AfterUninstall`, tenant lifecycle callbacks, and install-mode callbacks so developers can observe the source-plugin lifecycle flow

## Manifest Scope

`plugin.yaml` keeps the plugin metadata, menu declarations, and button permissions. Pages and SQL assets still follow directory conventions instead of being duplicated in metadata.

`plugin.yaml` does not declare source-plugin HTTP routes. Workspace navigation still comes from `menus`, while backend routes are registered by plugin code.

## Backend Integration

- implement backend entry points under `backend/`
- keep service logic under `backend/internal/service/`
- keep plugin-local ORM codegen output under `backend/internal/dao` and `backend/internal/model/{do,entity}` when the plugin accesses database tables
- register plugin APIs under `registrar.Routes().APIPrefix()`, which resolves to `/x/linapro-demo-source`; the sample appends `/api/v1` as its own route convention
- keep public pages, portals, static routes, or plugin-owned fallback handlers on non-reserved paths instead of putting them under `/x`
- register install, upgrade, disable, uninstall, tenant, and install-mode lifecycle callbacks through the source-plugin registration entry used by the host build
- keep plugin-owned cleanup logic in the plugin service so uninstall can optionally purge files before uninstall SQL drops the table

## Front-end Integration

- front-end pages are discovered from the plugin's `frontend/` directory according to repository conventions
- the sample page keeps the existing summary card and adds a `VXE` grid plus modal form for record CRUD
- the uninstall choice is surfaced by the host plugin-management page, not by the plugin page itself

## Public Assets

Source plugins may declare public static asset directories in `plugin.yaml` `public_assets`. Declared files are served from `/x-assets/{plugin-id}/{version}/...`, but this sample keeps its workbench page under the normal `frontend/pages/` discovery flow and does not require host-served public assets.

Do not use `/plugin-assets`; that legacy path is not supported.

## SQL Conventions

- install SQL lives under `manifest/sql/`
- uninstall SQL lives under `manifest/sql/uninstall/`
- install SQL should be idempotent so reinstall after a non-purge uninstall can preserve data
- uninstall SQL should be paired with plugin cleanup hooks when stored files must be removed together with table data

## Review Checklist

- metadata stays minimal and accurate
- host wiring remains explicit
- pages follow directory conventions
- plugin-owned SQL is kept separate from host SQL
- disable keeps plugin-owned data intact
- uninstall supports both retain-data and purge-data paths
