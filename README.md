# LinaPro Plugins

`official-plugins` is the official source-plugin workspace for LinaPro.

When mounted into the main `linapro` repository, this workspace appears at `apps/lina-plugins/`.

At the current open-source stage, the host keeps only stable core capabilities such as user management, role management, menu management, dictionary management, parameter settings, file management, scheduled job management, plugin governance, and developer support. Non-core business modules are delivered as source plugins under `apps/lina-plugins/<plugin-id>/`.

## What Lives Here

LinaPro currently ships these plugin references in this directory:

- `linapro-demo-source`: sample source plugin structure and coding reference
- `linapro-demo-dynamic`: sample dynamic WASM plugin structure and lifecycle reference
- official source plugins: first-party business plugins compiled into the host through explicit wiring

## Using as a Submodule

The main `linapro` repository mounts this repository at `apps/lina-plugins` using:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For local submodule management in a checked-out `linapro` workspace, the SSH remote is:

```text
git@github.com:linaproai/official-plugins.git
```

## Official Source Plugins

The repository currently includes these first-party source plugins:

- `linapro-ops-demo-guard`: demo-environment read-only request guard
- `linapro-org-core`: department management and post management
- `linapro-content-notice`: notice management
- `linapro-monitor-online`: online user query and force logout
- `linapro-monitor-server`: server monitor collection, cleanup, and query
- `linapro-monitor-operlog`: operation log persistence and governance
- `linapro-monitor-loginlog`: login log persistence and governance

Each official plugin has its own directory and follows the same baseline structure:

```text
apps/lina-plugins/<plugin-id>/
  backend/
    api/                Plugin API DTOs and route contracts
    internal/
      controller/       Plugin HTTP controllers
      service/          Plugin business services
      dao/              Plugin-local generated DAO objects when database access exists
      model/do/         Plugin-local generated DO objects when database access exists
      model/entity/     Plugin-local generated entity objects when database access exists
    hack/config.yaml    Plugin-local GoFrame codegen config
    plugin.go           Plugin backend registration entry
  frontend/pages/       Plugin pages mounted by host menus
  manifest/sql/         Plugin-owned install SQL assets
  manifest/sql/mock-data/ Optional plugin-owned mock/demo SQL assets
  manifest/sql/uninstall/ Plugin-owned uninstall SQL assets
  hack/tests/e2e/       Optional plugin-owned E2E TC files
  hack/tests/pages/     Optional plugin-owned E2E page objects
  hack/tests/support/   Optional plugin-owned E2E helpers
  plugin.yaml           Plugin manifest
  plugin_embed.go       Embedded asset registration
  README.md             English plugin guide
  README.zh-CN.md       Chinese plugin guide
```

`backend/internal/service/` is the only valid location for plugin service components. Do not create `backend/service/`.

## Host and Plugin Boundary

The host and source plugins are intentionally decoupled through stable seams instead of scattered `if pluginEnabled` branches.

- The host owns stable top-level menu catalogs such as `dashboard`, `iam`, `setting`, `scheduler`, `extension`, and `developer`.
- Plugin manifests choose their own `parent_key` mount points. The host only resolves the referenced menu record during sync and rejects missing parents to avoid orphaned menu trees.
- Official plugins keep their intended menu placement in their own `plugin.yaml`; the host does not hard-code official plugin IDs or force specific parent catalogs.
- The host publishes stable capability seams for optional collaboration, such as auth events, audit events, org capability access, and plugin lifecycle hooks.
- Plugin-owned tables, menus, pages, hooks, and cron jobs live in the plugin directory and are installed or removed through the plugin lifecycle.

## HTTP Routes and Public Assets

Source-plugin HTTP routes are implementation details registered by plugin backend code. Do not declare public routes, portal routes, workspace API routes, or route groups in `plugin.yaml`.

Use `registrar.Routes().APIPrefix()` for source-plugin APIs. The returned prefix is `/x/{plugin-id}`; this plugin-owned namespace is mandatory, while segments after it are plugin-defined route content. A plugin may choose conventional paths such as `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`, or `/interface/m1` under that prefix. Source plugins may still register non-reserved public routes such as `/`, `/portal/*`, or `/assets/*` for pages, portals, static resources, or plugin-managed fallback handlers.

`plugin.yaml` `menus` remains the source of truth for management workspace navigation and permissions. Registering an HTTP route does not create menus, permission nodes, `OpenAPI` entries, or workspace route metadata.

Source plugins and dynamic plugins may declare public static asset directories through `plugin.yaml` `public_assets`. The host serves only declared public assets from `/x-assets/{plugin-id}/{version}/...`, and treats each declaration as the plugin author's explicit publication boundary. Declarations must stay inside the plugin-owned resource set; traversal, absolute paths, URLs, wildcard paths, overlapping mounts, and symlink escapes are rejected. 

## Source Plugin Development Flow

1. Create `apps/lina-plugins/<plugin-id>/`.
2. Follow the structure used by `linapro-demo-source/`.
3. Declare metadata, menus, frontend pages, SQL assets, and optional hooks in `plugin.yaml`.
4. Keep plugin-owned backend code inside the plugin directory, place service logic under `backend/internal/service/`, and depend only on published host packages.
5. Register the plugin explicitly in `apps/lina-plugins/lina-plugins.go`.

## Plugin-Owned E2E Tests

Source plugins should keep plugin-specific Playwright coverage under `apps/lina-plugins/<plugin-id>/hack/tests/e2e/`.
Plugin page objects and helpers should stay beside them in `hack/tests/pages/` and `hack/tests/support/`.
The host test runner discovers these tests through the generic `plugins` scope, and a single plugin can be run with `pnpm -C hack/tests test:module -- plugin:<plugin-id>` without adding a plugin-specific entry to the execution manifest.

## Source Plugin Version Upgrade

When a source plugin has already been installed in the host and you bump its
`plugin.yaml` version, discovery no longer replaces the effective host version
automatically.

- The current effective version stays pinned in `sys_plugin.version` and `release_id`.
- The higher discovered source version is stored as a prepared `sys_plugin_release`.
- Before the host is allowed to start, update the source plugin through the supported plugin workspace update flow.
- If you skip that step, host startup fails fast and prints the plugins that still need attention.

## Dynamic Plugin Notes

Dynamic WASM plugins remain supported for runtime-managed delivery scenarios. Use `linapro-demo-dynamic/` as the reference when the plugin must be uploaded, installed, enabled, disabled, and uninstalled without recompiling the host.
